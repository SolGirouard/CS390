\paragraph{Problem 1} %(Collaborated with AAA, BBB, and CCC.)

The Nash equilibria are still two, the one that all choose the lower route,
and the one that only one choose the upper route. 
Obviously, the first one has worse objective funcion which is $1$ no matter what value $d$ holds. \\
To compute the price of anarchy, we need to calculate the cost under the best stuation.
Suppose there are $k$ person choose the lower route, 
let $c$ be the value of the objective function.
\begin{align*}
    c &= \frac{n - k + (\frac{k}{n})^dk}{n}  \\
      &= \frac{n - k + k^{d + 1}/n^d}{n} \\
    c' &= -\frac{1}{n} + (d + 1)k^d/n^{d + 1} 
\end{align*}
To make $c$ be the minimum, the derivetive should be $0$. 
\begin{align*}
	k &= \frac{n}{(d + 1)^{1/d}} \\ 
	c &= 1 - (d + 1)^{-1/d} + (d + 1)^{-1-1/d}  \\
	  &= 1 - (1 + d)^{1/d \cdot -1} + (1 + d)^{1/d \cdot -(d + 1)}
\end{align*}
When $n$ goes to infinity, PoA goes to $\frac{1}{1 - (d + 1)^{-1/d} + (d + 1)^{-1-1/d}}$. \\
When $d$ goes to infinity,  
$c$ goes to $0$.\\
Then PoA goes to infinity.

\paragraph{Problem 2} %(Collaborated with YYY and ZZZ.)

Suppose the strategy set having the best sum of utility is $S$,
and the strategy set of the NE having the worst objective function  is $S'$.\\
Consider a single player $i$, 
if the absolute value of his utility in the NE exceed n times his utility in the $S$,
then he can choose his route in $S$, 
since no matter how many people choose the same route as him,
his cost on this route won't exceed $n$ times any possible cost on this route. \\
Then for any player, in NE, 
the absolute value of his cost won't exceed $n$ times that of his cost in $S$.
Then the absolute value of total cost in NE won't exceed $n$ times that of the best objective function.\\
Therefore, the price of anarchy won't exceed $1$.
